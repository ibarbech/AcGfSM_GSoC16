The steps to build such a component are published in the following link:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ibarbech/robocomp/blob/automaticstatesmachine/doc/Generate_State_Machine_With_robocompcdsl.md\r\n\r\nAll commits is in the follow link:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ibarbech/robocomp/commits/automaticstatesmachine?author=ibarbech\r\n\r\n###Post\r\n\r\n1.

This code uses a state machine for each of the six legs of the hexapod. Each leg has been modified to place a pressure sensor at the distal tip and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) has been addet to the robot's body. These devices are used along with the state machines to stabilize the hexapod on uneven ground using free adaptive gaits.\r\n\r\nThere are still some limitation I am working on that limit the communication speed with the legs.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ibarbech/hexapod-robot\r\n",
